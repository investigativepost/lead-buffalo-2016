<p>Neighborhoods on the city’s East and Lower West Sides are “ground zero” for the worst lead poisoning problems in all of Upstate New York. Lead paint is considered the culprit, but the crisis in Flint, Michigan, has raised questions about the safety of the drinking water in cities like Buffalo.</p>

<p>The testing program used by Buffalo to determine whether drinking water is safe does not target the minority neighborhoods where the lead poisoning problem is concentrated, an analysis by Investigative Post has found.</p>

<p>Instead, the city has focused on predominantly white neighborhoods in North and South Buffalo that report few, if any, lead poisoning cases.</p>

<p>Consider the disparity: The city collected only five of 300 samples in the past five rounds of testing from homes in the ZIP Code located in the heart of the East Side.</p>

<p>By contrast, the city collected 41 out of the 300 samples from homes in the ZIP Code that covers predominantly white neighborhoods in North Buffalo where not a single child was diagnosed with high lead levels in recent years.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mayor Byron Brown said he wasn’t alarmed by Investigative Post’s findings.</p>

<p>“I’m not concerned because our water is good in the City of Buffalo,” the mayor said.</p>

<p>But Investigative Post found serious shortcomings in the city’s testing program that extend beyond the racial disparities and call into question the mayor’s claim that the city’s drinking water supply is safe.</p>

<p>Two national experts who helped bring to light the lead in drinking water crises in Flint and Washington, D.C., said Investigative Post’s findings are concerning. They are particularly  troubled by the lack of testing in high-risk neighborhoods.</p>

<p>“If you’re not sampling in those neighborhoods, how do you know that the water is safe?” said Marc Edwards, a civil engineering professor at Virginia Tech University.</p>

<p>“I certainly would take the position that it is morally highly questionable, if not outright wrong,” added Yanna Lambrinidou, a Washington, D.C., activist who served on a federal Environmental Protection Agency advisory panel that recommended revisions to the federal drinking water regulation that deals with lead.</p>

<p>In addition to the disparity in the sampling program, Investigative Post found:</p>

<p>Buffalo’s program appears to be in violation of federal law for its failure to focus testing efforts on the houses considered most at risk.
Up to a quarter of the homes sampled in 2014 belonged to current or former city employees or their family members. Many of these employees work for the water or public works departments.
Buffalo has not acted on the federal recommendations to be transparent about the location of lead service lines, which are the chief source of lead in drinking water.
The Erie County Health Department rarely tests drinking water for lead in homes where a child has been diagnosed a high blood-lead level.</p>

<p>One community activist went so far as to accuse city and county officials of misleading residents.</p>

<p>“Basically, what I have found is that everybody from the county down to the local city system will lie out their rear-ends to not tell parents the truth that the water lines are lead,” said Carolette Meadows.</p>

<p>Oluwole McFoy, chairman of the Buffalo Water Board, acknowledged that there were “holes” in the sampling program that officials are trying to fix.</p>

<p>“We look at it as: it is not enough to do it the way we’ve been doing it,” he said.</p>

<p>High lead poisoning rates</p>

<p>Buffalo has the biggest lead poisoning problem in Upstate, with hundreds of children diagnosed each year in black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the East and lower West Sides. The problem dates back years: inner-city neighborhoods accounted for three of the four upstate ZIP codes reporting the most new lead poisoning cases for a three-year period ending in 2012.</p>

<p>“Buffalo is ground zero in the entire country for lead poisoning,” said David Hahn-Baker, a local environmental activist who has studied the lead problem for three decades.</p>

<p>A child diagnosed with high blood-lead levels can suffer irreversible harm, such as a lowered IQ and developmental delays. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined there is no safe blood lead level in children.</p>

<p>Lead paint in Buffalo’s old housing stock is cited as the chief culprit. But the crisis in Flint, where dangerous levels of lead were found in drinking water in February 2015, has raised serious questions about water quality in cities like Buffalo that have older infrastructure.</p>

<p>Buffalo’s aging drinking water infrastructure is part of a growing problem across New York. The estimated cost of repairing and updating the state’s drinking water systems is almost $40 billion.
Houses in Buffalo built before 1940 are more likely to have a lead service line that carry water from the street into the house. Experts say these homes are most at-risk for having lead in their drinking water.</p>

<p>“It’s like drinking water through a 30-foot lead straw,” said Edwards, the national expert.</p>

<p>Homes built before 1986 are more likely to have plumbing inside that contains lead – such as in solder used to connect pipes.</p>

The EPA sets the lead action limit at 15 parts per billion. Ten percent of the samples in any given testing round need to be above that limit to trigger action by the water utilty, which has not happened in Buffalo for the past five rounds.
